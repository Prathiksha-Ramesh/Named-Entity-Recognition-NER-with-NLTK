# Named Entity Recognition (NER) with NLTK

This repository contains the source code and resources for a project focused on performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The project demonstrates how to tokenize text, perform part-of-speech tagging, and identify named entities within a sentence using Python.

## Project Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. This project uses NLTK, a powerful Python library for NLP, to perform NER on a given sentence.

The project demonstrates:
- Tokenization: Splitting the sentence into individual words.
- POS Tagging: Assigning part-of-speech tags to each token.
- NER Chunking: Identifying and classifying named entities.

## Project Structure

- **notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for performing NER using NLTK.
- **LICENSE**: The Apache License 2.0 file that governs the use and distribution of this project's code.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project, including NLTK and other necessary packages.
- **.gitignore**: A file specifying which files or directories should be ignored by Git.

## Installation
